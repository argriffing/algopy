ISSUES:
    * broadcasting for UTPM instances is not implemented yet. i.e.
      x = UTPM(numpy.random.rand((2,3,4))
      y = dot(x,x) + x
      will most likely raise an error
      
    * some algorithms require vectors to be columns of a matrix.
      I.e. if x is a vector it should be initialized as
      x = UTPM(numpy.random.rand(D,P,N,1) and not as
      UTPM(numpy.random.rand(D,P,N)) as one would typically do it using numpy.
      
    * there is no vectorized reverse mode yet. That means that one can compute 
      columns of a Jacobian of dimension (M,N) by propagating N directional 
      derivatives at once. In the reverse mode one would like to propagate M
      adjoint directions at once. However, this is not implemented yet, i.e. one
      has to repeat the procedure M times.
